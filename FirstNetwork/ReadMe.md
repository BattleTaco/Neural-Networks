This is my first network that is built from the bottom up. This network is supposed to take in a dataset from MNIST. The network trains to learn how to print out the
correct number from a handwritten digit. These digits are handwritten and created by workers and high school students. I seperate a training set and a testing set and 
this neural network does not use any external libraries except numpy for linear algebra and random to randomize the biases and weights.
